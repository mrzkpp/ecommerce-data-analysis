# E-Commerce Data Analysis Dashboard âœ¨

## Introduction
The E-Commerce Data Analysis Dashboard is an interactive data analysis project focused on uncovering insights within an e-commerce dataset. This project aims to answer critical business questions such as identifying high-demand product categories, analyzing geographic purchase patterns, and understanding payment method preferences across different customer demographics.

Leveraging a combination of data science techniques and an interactive Streamlit dashboard, this project demonstrates the impact of data-driven decisions in the e-commerce domain.

## Features
- **Product Demand Analysis**: Identifies product categories with the highest demand and explores purchasing patterns based on geography.
- **Payment Preference Insights**: Analyzes customer payment preferences and explores variations based on demographics.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Built with Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface for real-time filtering and visualization of key metrics.

## Installation & Setup
